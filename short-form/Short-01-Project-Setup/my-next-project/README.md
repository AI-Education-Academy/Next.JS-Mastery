This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To create a new project with the latest Next.js, run one of the following commands:

Using NPX:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-project
```
Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn create next-app my-next-project
```
Using PNPM:
```bash
pnpm  create next-app my-next-project
```
After the installation completes, navigate into your project directory by running:
```bash
cd my-next-project
```

The cd my-next-project command changes your working directory to your project folder so you can begin development.

Next, start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Fonts

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
